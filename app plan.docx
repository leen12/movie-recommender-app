Phase 1: Research and Planning
Lay the foundation for development.

1. Select Movie APIs
- [x] The Movie Database (TMDb): Free API for movie/TV metadata (titles, genres, posters, ratings). Get an API key at tmdb.org.
- [ ] TVmaze: Free, excellent for TV show episode data. No key needed—see tvmaze.com/api.
- [ ] Open Movie Database (OMDb): Optional for extra data (e.g., IMDb ratings). Free tier at omdbapi.com.
- [ ] Action: Review API terms to ensure compliance with caching/display rules.

2. Define Features and User Flow
- [x] User Journey: Sign up → Browse/Search → Watch/Track → Create Lists → Get Recommendations → Share/Rate.
- [x] Prioritization: Begin with authentication, browsing, and tracking; then add advanced features (e.g., recommendations, gamification).

3. Design Database Schema (MongoDB)
- [x] Users: { id, email, hashedPassword, preferences, profile, badges }
- [x] Watch History: { userId, contentId, type (movie/episode), watchedDate, progress }
- [x] Custom Lists: { userId, listName, contentIds, isPublic }
- [x] Ratings: { userId, contentId, rating (1-5), timestamp }
- [x] Reviews: { userId, contentId, reviewText, timestamp }
- [x] Badges: { badgeId, name, description, criteria }
- [x] Cached API Data: { contentId, title, genre, poster, rating, cachedDate }
